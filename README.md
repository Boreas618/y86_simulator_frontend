# Build

To build a Flutter project, you can use the flutter build command. This command will create a compiled version of your Flutter app, which you can then use to run the app on a device or distribute it to others.

To use the flutter build command, you will need to open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the root directory of your Flutter project. From there, you can run the following command:

```
flutter build <platform>
```

Replace <platform> with the name of the platform you want to build your app for, such as ios for iOS or android for Android.

For example, to build an Android app, you would run the following command:

```
flutter build android
```
  
This will create a compiled version of your app in the build/ directory of your Flutter project. You can then use this compiled app to run it on a device or distribute it to others.

If you want to build your app for a specific target platform, such as a specific version of Android or iOS, you can use the --target-platform flag to specify the target platform. For example, to build an Android app for Android 10, you would run the following command:

```
flutter build android --target-platform android-10
```
  
For more information on the flutter build command and its options, you can run the following command:

```
flutter build --help
```
  
This will display a list of available options and flags for the flutter build command, which you can use to customize the way your app is built.
